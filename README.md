Dyuthi Font
============
Dyuthi is an ornamental typographic design that supports Latin and Malayalam. The glyph patterns are based on popular 'bulged ended' type designs which used to be popular in Malayalam designs. The font comes in one size and is thicker than usual Malayalam fonts, hence is suited for titling and headlines. Dyuthi can accompany Meera or Rachana as title font, when they are used as body text.

The font is designed by Hiran Venugopalan and maintained by Swathanthra Malayalam Computing. Source code is available at https://gitlab.com/smc/dyuthi/ .
